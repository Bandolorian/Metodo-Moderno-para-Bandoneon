This project is to transcribe the sheet music in "Metodo Moderno para Bandoneon" by Carlos Marcucci Y Felix Lipesker using notation software.

## Reason for the Project
"Metodo Moderno para Bandoneon" is out of print and the only copies online are very badly scanned. However, the way Carlos Marcucci & Felix Lipesker teaches bandoneon should be preserved and celebrated. Because of the bad scan, the sheet music is often times difficult to read. 

This is a project to transcribe the sheet music using modern music notation software and then have the files available for ease of electronic viewing on a tablet or printed on paper.
