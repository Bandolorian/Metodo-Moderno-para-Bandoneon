<img src="images/Metodo Moderno para Bandoneon.jpg" width="30%" align="right">

This project is to transcribe the sheet music in "Metodo Moderno para Bandoneon" by Carlos Marcucci Y Felix Lipesker using music notation software.

## Reason for the Project
"Metodo Moderno para Bandoneon" is out of print and the only copies online are very badly scanned. However, the way Carlos Marcucci & Felix Lipesker teaches bandoneon should made easier to view by future students. Because of the bad scan, the sheet music is often times difficult to read. 

This is a project to transcribe the sheet music using modern music notation software. The resulting digital version of the sheet music can be more easily viewed, and if others are interested, farther updated. It will also be more legible on tablets or when printed.

## Newly Transcribed Pages
Newly transcribed pages in the book are:
- [Pages 49-52](https://github.com/Bandolorian/Metodo-Moderno-para-Bandoneon/blob/main/Transcribed%20Pages/Metodo%20Moderno%20para%20Bandoneon_Page%2049-52.pdf), "Escalas Mayores" / "Major Scales"
- [Pages 174-175](https://github.com/Bandolorian/Metodo-Moderno-para-Bandoneon/blob/main/Transcribed%20Pages/Metodo%20Moderno%20para%20Bandoneon_Page%20174-175.pdf), "Cadencia" / "Cadence"
- [Pages 181](https://github.com/Bandolorian/Metodo-Moderno-para-Bandoneon/blob/main/Transcribed%20Pages/Metodo%20Moderno%20para%20Bandoneon_Page%20181.pdf) and [182](https://github.com/Bandolorian/Metodo-Moderno-para-Bandoneon/blob/main/Transcribed%20Pages/Metodo%20Moderno%20para%20Bandoneon_Page%20182.pdf), "Cielito Mio" by Osvaldo Fresedo

## Full Book Is Available
In wanting the book to be usable, I cleaned up all of the pages from the original scan, as best as I could. Inserted the few newly transcribed pages and releasing a complete book. If nothing else, it should be more legible compared to the original scan. As new transcriptions are done, they will be replacing the original scanned pages.

Starting from 1.x.x and higher, the releases are complete books with all pages.
